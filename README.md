# Neural-Network-NLP
As a final project for my Machine Learning class, this is a follow-on to my Capstone/Thesis project.

In the Capstone/Thesis project, I had used a TF-IDF Vectorizer and Support Vector Machine to classify the text reviews on TripAdvisor into a 1-5 rating system. These now-numerical features were then incoporated into the recommender systems models I built.

I had read several research papers about the use of Neural Networks and Deep Learning to perform better text analysis/NLP, so I decided to implement them and try to get a better accuracy than I did on the Capstone/Thesis project. This time, after pulling in the JSON files, I removed the other features and just left the text, to speed processing time.

I built 4 neural network models for this analysis: CNN, RNN, CNN + RNN,  and RNN LSTM.
