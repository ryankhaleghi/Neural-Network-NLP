# Neural-Network-NLP
A machine learning class project on NLP using neural networks for sentiment analysis

This is a follow-on to my capstone/thesis project where I used a "bag of words" model to classify the review text.
I wanted to see if I could build a deep learning neural network model that would perform better.
